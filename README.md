# Fitness Class Tracker

Welcome to my Sinatra Portfolio Project! Since I don't have a traditional gym membership but love being apart of group workouts, I designed this app to keep track of any exercise classes I take. This app allows myself and others to easily create, edit and/or delete classes as necessary.

## Installation

To install this app:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run rake db:migrate

## Usage

To use this app:

1. Run shotgun

Everything should be set up.
